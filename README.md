## Overview
This repository introduces a Java program designed to assist in prioritizing patients in a busy emergency room. The program utilizes a Patient class, assigning each patient a priority number ranging from 1 to 3. By implementing the Comparable<Patient> interface and overriding the compareTo() method, the program enables the sorting of patients based on their priority levels. This program aims to optimize patient care by ensuring that individuals requiring immediate medical attention receive timely treatment in emergency room settings.
